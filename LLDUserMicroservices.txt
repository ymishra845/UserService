Low-Level Design (LLD) for Microservices Project
Overview
This project involves creating a microservices architecture with three main services: User Service, Discussion Service, and Comment & Like Service. Each service will have its own responsibilities, and they will communicate with each other as needed. The architecture will include REST APIs, database interactions, and inter-service communication.
